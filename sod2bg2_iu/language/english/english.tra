@0 = ~Ach!, The ichor on this damned blade nearly burned right through me glove!  Be this sword from the hells themselves?~
@1 = ~Hmm, the hilt on this blade be in rather rough shape, dunnae ye think?  It could be reforged with Githyanki's silver hilt if'n ye could wrestle one away from the beasts.  Mighty dangerous that be, they regard them as a haughty paladin would a holy avenger.  But if'n ye manage to find one, bring it to me, and I'll reforge this caustic carver of yers into something that will strike fear into those blasted mind-flayers.~
@2 = ~Let's see if ye got what I need to reforge that hellish blade of yours...~
@3 = ~Well, let's see what else ye got.~
@4 = ~A corrosive dagger ye got here, eh?  Looks like it's been chewed up and spit out...~
@5 = ~I can fix up this dagger of yers, and make it even more useful as one ye can throw if ye can bring me the Boomerang Dagger +2 to reforge it with.~
@6 = ~Ah, this be the Boomerang Dagger!  A mere 5,000gp and I can get right tae work on fixing up yer corroded dagger.~
@7 = ~What's this? A right nice pair of boots these are, quite soft and quiet.~
@8 = ~I could improve these boots with some liquid mercury and a commission of 7500gp.~
@9 = ~Ah, thats some liquid mercury alright, I can improve these boots with them.~
@10 = ~What've ye got here?  Hah! a crown of false gemstones and gold.  Still, it seems to have a bit o' enchantment to it...~
@11 = ~I could refit this lying crown of yers with enchanted ioun stones to improve it.  Obsidian, lavendar, clear, and scarlet/blue would do the trick.~
@12 = ~These looks to be the stones I need.  If'n ye can part with a mere 5,000gp, I can reforge that crown of yours into one fit for a king if ye'd like.~
@13 = ~Blessed be!  A fine dwarven helm bearing the mark of Dumathoin!~
@14 = ~All I would need are some good horns, and 5,000gp and I can make the glory of Dumathoin really shine from this helm.~
@15 = ~These horns will do nicely, I can use these to make that dwarven helm of yours into something Dumathoin himself would be proud to wear.~
@16 = ~Hmm, an amulet made of petrified eyes?  Cannae say I've ever seen anything of the like.~
@17 = ~I might be able to make these old eyes see further with a scroll of farsight, wizard eye, a couple of potions of perception, and 5,000gp.~
@18 = ~Here we are, the scrolls and potions I need to enhanced those blind eyes on your amulet.~
@19 = ~This be a nice belt o' skill you have here, Keenedge's work if'n I'm not mistaken.~
@20 = ~Ol' Cromwell can make this belt even better for ye, I just need some gauntlets of weapon skill and expertise along with a scroll of distintegrate to transfer the magics and 10,000gp for the work.~
@21 = ~Ye got the gauntlets and scroll, I can get to work on improving Sa'yan's belt for ye if'n ye want.~
@22 = ~Nice sharp throwing dart ye have here, I almost pricked me fingers on it.~
@23 = ~I can improve this bloody dart of yours with five scrolls of melf's acid arrow, five sphene gems, and 5,000gp.~

@25 = ~Bloody hells!  Just touching this blade's hilt makes me feel as weak as a young lass!~
@26 = ~I cannae enhance this blade unless ye finds me a skull of dark power, mayhap a lich's.  And I would need 15,000gp for me trouble.~
@27 = ~I'll be a basilisk's lunch, that be a dark skull from a lich alright.  I can use it to enhance that black blade of yours.~
@28 = ~Bloody hells!  Just touching this hammer's haft makes me feel as weak as a young lass!~

@33 = ~Aye, ioun stones of both gold and dusty rose ye have here, I can get to work on that musician's hat o' yours if ye would like.~
@34 = ~What've ye got there, a Thayvian mage's robe?~
@35 = ~If'n ye happen to come across the robe of vecna, I can use its threading and magics to enhance that flamin' conjurer's robe of yours.  It would cost ye 10,000gp for the commission.~
@36 = ~I see ye've managed to get the old lich's robe, quite impressive.  I can use it to improve that Thayvian robe if'n ye want.~
@37 = ~What's this now?  One of the bucklers from those mercenaries at Baldur's Gate?~
@38 = ~This old dwarf can rework that Flaming Fist buckler of yours into something special if'n ye can provide me with a reflection shield +1, two scrolls of protection against normal missiles, two potions of mirrored eyes, and 10,000gp for me trouble.~
@39 = ~Ye've got the reflection shield, scrolls, and potions.  I can rework that Flaming Fist buckler of yours if'n ye would like.~
@40 = ~Is this?.... Hah!  It is!  The false "Crom Faeyr".  Where in the realms did you find this accursed thing?~
@41 = ~Hmmm, I might be able to improve that accursed hammer if'n you can find me a rune of clangeddin to scribe into it.  It would take 5,000gp fer the work.~
@42 = ~This be one of the clangeddin runes alright, I can use it to enhance that blasphemous hammer of yours.~
@43 = ~What've ye here?  The balance and heft of this burning blade be all wrong, was it even made to be held by mortal hands?~
@44 = ~I can reforge that unbalanced flamin' blade of yours, and make it a far more effective and balanced weapon.  I would just need a sword of flame, a blade of searing, and five scrolls of agannazar's scorcher.  7,500gp for the day's work at the forge and it'd be a done deal for ye.~
@45 = ~A flaming sword, a searing blade, and five of the scorcher scrolls.  I can get right to work on reforging that unweildy burning sword of yours if ye'd like.~
@46 = ~Ahhh, just lookin' at these boots reminds me of gazin' at the skies over the harbor at night.~
@47 = ~If'n ye want me to improve Crommus' old boots for ye, I'd need a few things.  Two potions each of magic protection, magic shielding, and magic blocking.~
@48 = ~Ye have all the potions I need here to reforge those starry boots, I would just need 5,000gp for me work at the forge.  Shall I get started on em for ye?~
@49 = ~Placeholder~
@50 = ~Ahh, I believe I recognize the craftmanship of this green dragonscale o' yers.  Jegg's work is it?  How is the ol' bird?~
@51 = ~I can rework this dragonscale into better armor if ye can bring me some red or shadow dragon scales.~
@52 = ~Aye, ye've collected some more scales from the dastardly beasts.  I can use 'em to reforge yer green dragonscale.~
@53 = ~I can use these red dragon scales to reforge the green dragonscale into lightweight scale armor or a suit of heavy plate.~
@54 = ~What've ye here, scales from a toxic green dragon?  Ach, the smell is enough to knock a buzzard off a gut-wagon.~
@55 = ~I can use these noxious scales to make for ye a lightweight suit of scale armor, a suit of heavy plate armor, a protective helmet, or even a sturdy shield.~
@56 = ~It'll cost ye 5,000gp and a day's worth of yer sweat helping at me forge.~
@57 = ~I can use these shadow dragon scales to reforge the green dragonscale into a lightweight scale armor, or a suit of heavy plate.~
@58 = ~Scales from a shadow dragon?  I can use these to further enhance your armor.~
@59 = ~This be a nice greatsword ye have here, a dragon's gift?  She looks rather worn...~
@60 = ~I can use either these red dragon scales or shadow dragon scales to reforge yer green dragonscale into lightweight scale armor or a suit of heavy plate.~
@61 = ~It'll cost ye 15,000 gold and since me apprentice would rather chase harlots and courtesans than work, ye'll need to stay on a day and help me run the forge.~
@62 = ~Well, let's see what else ye've got then.~
@63 = ~I can reforge this blade, I would just need a sharp new blade for the forgin'.  A Githyanki's vorpal blade of silver would work best.~
@64 = ~Ahh yes, this be a vorpal blade alright, I can use it to reforge that dragon's sword of yours, along with 7,500 gold for me trouble.~
@65 = ~The Verdant Crimson Dragon Plate?  Ye wish to improve it further, eh?~

@68 = ~Ye would like to enhance that silver dragon's blade of yers further, ye say?~
@69 = ~Scales from a white dragon? I can use these to further enhance your armor.~
@70 = ~Scales from a dragon of noble silver?  It saddens this old dwarf to know such a majestic creature fell for these scales.  I cannae let this creature's death be in vain, I can use these to improve your armor.~
@71 = ~Enhancing your silver dragon further blade be a tall order, I'd need an elemental gemstone for it, and 10,000gp to fit it to your sword.~
@72 = ~Scales from a blue dragon?  I can use these to enhance your armor.~
@73 = ~Looks like ye have an elemental gem of frost here, I can use this to enhance your dragon blade with.~
@74 = ~It'll cost ye 20,000 gold, and since me apprentice has ran off to Waterdeep with a rather homely courtesan, I'll need yer help at the forge once again.~
@75 = ~I can use these dragon scales to enhance your dragonscale armor with.~
@76 = ~Fancy yerself a dragonslayer, do ye?  I can use any of these scales to enhance your dragonscale armor with.~

@82 = ~Ye have everything I need here to upgrade those stalker gauntlets of yers.  It'll be 10,000gp and I'll need yer help at me forge.  Me son of a kobald of an apprentice was out all hours deep in his cups with the blasted courtesans again.~
@83 = ~The Scorched Earth again eh?  Not hot enough for ye?  Heh.~
@84 = ~Be a difficult task to make this blade burn hotter... but I might just be able to do it for ye if'n ye can find me an elemental gem of flame.  Oh, and a small commission for me work, 15,000gp should cover it.  And lest I forget, I'll need yer help for the day at me forge.  That damnable apprentice of mine has gone and knocked up a half-orc lass.  I doubt I will ever see him again, heh.~
@85 = ~Looks like ye found an elemental gem of flame, they be rare as hen's teeth.  Shall we get started on mounting it into yer blade?~
@86 = ~What've ye got here?  A lucky belt ye say?~
@87 = ~Methinks I can make this belt even more "lucky" for ye and yer friends with five scrolls of luck and 10,000gp.~
@88 = ~Ye have everything I need to fix up that lucky belt for ye, I'll just need yer help at the forge again.  That half orc lass did a real number on me apprentice, he's going to be laid up a few days at least, the scoundrel.  Shall we begin?~
@89 = ~Now this is an odd bird, a cursed staff that's uncursed...but still cursed?~
@90 = ~I may just be able to empower that accursed stick o' yers a bit.  I would need a wand of fire, a wand of frost, and 5,000gp.~
@91 = ~Aye, ye got the wands I need here for the uncursed staff.  Would ye like me to do the work?  As much as I hate ta ask, I'll need yer help again.   My apprentice be at the temple with the half-orc lass, she be makin' an honest man o' him whether he want it or not, ha!~
@92 = ~Ahh, yer accursed stick again, ye would like to have it recharged ye say?~
@93 = ~Ol' Cromwell might be able to work some more magic into that old stick with another wand of fire, a wand of frost, and another 5,000gp for me trouble.~
@94 = ~Ye have another wand of fire and frost here too, shall we get to work?  Me apprentice is away on his honeymoon with the half-orc lass at the Low Lantern in Baldur's Gate, I'll need ye to help me again.~
@95 = ~Ahh, ye've got an old backwhacker here, I could use one of these for me bastard apprentice.  Just to keep 'im in line o' course.~
@96 = ~If'n ye come accross a wyvern tail and a gnasher club, I can reforge this backwhacker into a really nasty implement for a rogue.  I'd just need a mere 5,000gp for me trouble.~
@97 = ~Ye've got the wyvern tail and gnasher.  Ye ready to get started on the whacker?  Just one day's worth of yer help at me forge again if'n ye can.  Me apprentice is nursing a hangover he says, Pfft.~
@98 = ~Hmm, be this bow of orcish origin?  Looks to be quite frightening.~
@99 = ~I can make this banshee's bow wail upon your enemies for you, I would just need something like some screaming bagpipes to make it do so, along with a bowstring of gesen or gond to hold it all together.~
@100 = ~I would need 10,000gp and yer help fer the day.  Me apprentice managed to smash his hand with me anvil and will be laid up fer awhile.~
@101 = ~I can use this silver hilt to reforge that devil's sword if ye would like, it would cost ye 10,000 gold fer the work.~
@102 = ~deprecated~
@103 = ~deprecated~
@104 = ~It doesn't look like ye have what I need to reforge that hellblade...~
@105 = ~Let's see if ye got all I need to rework this orcish bow...~ 
@106 = ~I can use this gesen bowstring along with yer bagpipes to improve your bow.~
@107 = ~I can use this bowstring of gond along with yer bagpipes to improve your bow.~
@108 = ~Quite the adventurer you must be to have bowstrings from gond and gesen.~
@109 = ~Ye have some of the parts here, but I'll need the screaming pipes along with one of the gond or gesen bowstrings to complete the work.~
@110 = ~I'd need 10,000gp and yer help fer the day at me forge.  That idiot Duergar apprentice of mine is down at the docks fishing again.  Fishing for harlots is what he really be doin', I wager.~
@111 = ~Nice gloves ye got here, just in me size too!~
@112 = ~I can reforge these gloves for ye and make them a better fit too with some extra materials. Mayhap some bracers of archery, a bracers of defense AC3, some gloves of pickpocketing and 5,000gp for the stitchwork.~

@122 = ~Ye have the cloak I need fer the lining, and the metaspell amulet for a new clasp.  5,000gp and we can get started.~
@123 = ~Hmmm, very nice dagger ye got here, imbued with all the elements at once?~
@124 = ~Ye know, this dagger o' yers would be much more useful if'n ye could throw it.  I could improve it as such with a boomerang dagger and 5,000gp fer the forgin'.~
@125 = ~Ye have a boomerang dagger here, I can use it to enhance that elemental dagger.  Me apprentice didn't show up again today, so I will need yer help fer the day.~
@126 = ~Ah, the elemental dagger again, ye want it further enhanced?~
@127 = ~Enhancing this elemental dagger is a tall order, ye would need to find me an elemental gem to use with it.~
@128 = ~I can use the Soul of Frost to enhance yer elemental dagger, I just need 5,000gp and yer help at the forge.~
@129 = ~Ach!  Ye should warn a dwarf before ye hand him a blasted pike that shocks ye!~
@130 = ~I could reforge the storm pike if'n ye find me a wave shaft to work with.~

@140 = ~I could reforge this inoun stone for ye, it needs a warrior's spirit to focus the power inside.  If'n ye can somehow find a pale green ioun stone in yer travels, I could use it, along with five scrolls of resist fear, and five potions of regeneration, and five potions of heroism to enhance yer ioun stone.~
@141 = ~This be the pale green stone I need, the potions and the scrolls.  Toss in 5,000gp for me coffers and I'll get to work for ye.~

@163 = ~Scales from a green dragon?  I can use these to further enhance your armor.~
@164 = ~Ye say ye would like yer Dragonscale Shield made sturdier?~
@165 = ~Hmmm, it would take some extremely tough scales to improve this shield, only some from a black dragon would work.~
@166 = ~Ye certainly are a brave one to have slain a black dragon for these scales.  I can use these to enhance yer shield.  I would need 7,500gp fer the commission, shall we begin work?~
@167 = ~Ye would like to improve the Tongue of Acid even further?~
@168 = ~It be a tall order to improve that hellblade more, I'd need to reforge it using an elemental gemstone and it would take 15,000gp fer my work at the forge.~
@169 = ~By the Soul Forger, an elemental gem of corrosive ichor?  Never thought I'd see such a thing in me lifetime.  I can use this to reforge yer hellblade.  I would just need 15,000gp and yer help at me forge again.~
@170 = ~Ey, whats this?  Appears to be Iriaeborian craftsmanship that forged this armor.~
@171 = ~I could greatly improve the protective ability of this shadowy rogue's gear.  If'n ye are able to bring down a grand drake of the shadows, bring me some of it's scales.~
@172 = ~Ye've gone and slain a big, dark, lizard 'ave ye?  These scales will do nicely for your Iriaeborian leathers.   Just a toss 7,500gp in fer me coffers and I'll get to work for ye.~
@173 = ~Ey?  What be this?  Some accursed bard's bracers?~
@174 = ~Hmmm, ye know, ol' Cromwell may be able to make these jokers' bracers better for ye.  It'd take some dark magic though.  I'd need to use the power from two demon's hearts along with 5,000gp fer me trouble, and I cannae gaurantee the curse would be lifted.~
@175 = ~Well now, ye've gone and carved two hearts from demons.  I'll not ask ye where from, but if'n ye would like me to use em to enhance those bracers of yers, I'll get to work right away.~
@176 = ~Ye have a blessed ring here, do ye?  Did ye pluck this one from Strohm's tomb?  I cannae hardly believe me eyes.~
@177 = ~I can improve this holy ring fer ya with an equally holy gemstone, such as the Eye of Tyr.~
@178 = ~Ah, yes indeed, this be the Eye of Tyr, I can use this to improve the ring of purity.  I just need 5,000gp and a day at the forge for the work.~
@179 = ~A Calimshite saber?  Nicely balanced and quick, ye would like it improved?~
@180 = ~I can reforge this blade if ye can bring me another fast saber, like the Belm +2, and a murky oil of speed to temper it with.~
@181 = ~Ye have the Belm +2 and the oil I need to reforge this blade for you, just 5,000gp fer me work and it's a done deal.~
@182 = ~Hmm, very interesting blade ye have here, dark as night, cold to the touch and seems to seethe with the anger of unfulfilled purpose.  Appears to be a sharran ceremonial blade with a lot of age to it, aye?~
@183 = ~Aye, I can enhance this blade for ye.  A gemstone of focused dark energy would empower this dark sword for ye if If mounted in place of the ceremonial stone in the crossguard.~
@184 = ~Let me rummage through yer pack and see if ye have something I can use to enhance this dark blade for ye...~
@185 = ~Hmm, what's this?  A stone ye retrieved from a powerful fiend of darkest shadow eh?  I can use this to enhance that dead priestess' blade of yours.~
@186 = ~Deprecated~
@187 = ~Deprecated~
@188 = ~I would just need the stone and 5,000gp for the commission to do the work.~
@189 = ~Deprecated~
@190 = ~Ah, blade of the dark moon goddess?  Ye wish it further enhanced?~
@191 = ~*ponders while stroking his beard*

Aye, it certainly be possible, the blade be good enough, but this ceremonial hilt is what be holding 'er back.  If ye can find and bring me a hilt suitable for such a dark blade, I can reforge it for ye.~
@192 = ~This certainly be a unique hilt ye have here, and I can feel the dark energies within.  Aye, this will work for Varscona's reforgin'.  I would just need 10,000gp for the work and yer help for the day once again at me forge, since I cannae rely on that rat-bastard apprentice.  I should have known better than to take that Duergar under me wing.~
@193 = ~It cannae be.... a magical axe from the lost Stonfire clan!  It was here in Athkatla in some blasted tavern, ye say?~
@194 = ~It'd be a right honor to enhance this fine piece o' dwarven craftsmanship for ye.  To do so would take nothing less than an elemental gemstone of flame and 10,000 gold crowns.~
@195 = ~Aye, this is certainly a gemstone of flame ye have here, shall we get to work on yer axe?~
@196 = ~Ah, this looks to be some scrappy ol' wizard's hat...~
@197 = ~If'n ye would like to have this old hat enhanced, it'd take some potent magics.  Methinks it would take the Circlet of Netheril, nothing less.~
@198 = ~Aye, this be the Cirlet of Netheril ye have here.  I can enhance that old pointy hat of yers with it along with a mere 10,000 gold crowns fer me trouble at tha' forge~
@199 = ~The Sourcerer's Cap?  Ye say ye would like it enhanced further?  Hmmm, let me think a moment...~
@200 = ~Yes, I believe I can enhance this cap o' yers.  I would need an ioun stone of bronze and 5,000 gold crowns~
@201 = ~Well then, ye certainly be proficient in the adventurin' business.  I can use this bronze ioun stone to enhance yer Sourcerer's Cap.  Are ye ready to help at me forge fer the day, <CHARNAME>?~
@202 = ~What be this? looks to be an unfinished garment constructed of human skin?  I'll not ask ye where ye got this from.~
@203 = ~With the right components, I could finish this ghastly thing into a completely serviceable piece of armor.  If ye are able to pry Vecna's robes from Ribald's greedy fingers, and find me some blood from a shadow dragon, I could finish the work.~
@204 = ~This be the old Lich's robe sure enough, and by the Soul Forger... is this murky vial filled with the life-blood from a Shadow Drake?  Such a sight to behold, it's almost as if this be bled from the very void itself.  With these, and a generous contribution of 10,000 gold crowns for the forgin' I will get to work on that fleshy garment for ye right away.~
@205 = ~Ye say ye would like the Lich's Raiment improved even further?  This be a tall order, even for me...~
@206 = ~I cannae make this armor any more powerful without an equally powerful artifact of dark magick.  If'n ye can somehow find an intact Lich's skull, I might be able to do something with it.~
@207 = ~Ye never cease to amaze this old dwarf.  How in the nine hells did ye come across this skull?  Never ye mind, it's not important.  If ye can suffer the loss of 10,000 more gold crowns, I can use this skull to improve that ghoulish mage armor of yers.~
@208 = ~What's this now? Some dusty old parchment?  Ah, ye have quite the find here friend, 'tis a majick-locked scroll, likely containing something special, eh?~
@209 = ~Me granda taught me a thing or two about these scrolls, and I can remove the seal for ye.  It requires meticulous tracing of the cantrip with dragon's blood from a steady hand.  Blood from any dragon will do the trick, but I have to tell ye, I cannae guarantee the same result twice, just the nature of such a seal, I'm afraid.~
@210 = ~Aye, ye've brought me some blood from those overgrown lizards.  I can use this in unsealing that scroll of yers.~
@211 = ~I can use this dragon's blood to unseal that scroll...~
@212 = ~I can use this shadow dragon's blood to unseal that scroll...~
@213 = ~I can use this silver dragon's blood to unseal that scroll...~
@214 = ~deprecated~
@215 = ~deprecated~
@216 = ~*spits in disgust at the sight of the vials of dragon's blood*

  Good riddiance to those scaly bastards, my dragonslayer friend.  I can use any of these vials of wyrm vitae to remove the seal on that scroll.~
@217 = ~In addition to the blood, I will need a sum 5,000 gold crowns for me time in removing the seal on yer old scroll.~
@218 = ~deprecated~
@219 = ~What's this ye've here?  Looks to be a Kara-Turan blade, but....doesn't appear to be forged by mortal hands....~
@220 = ~Ye say ye would like this blade improved?  Aye, I can do it, but I'll need something special.  If'n ye can find me a a gemstone of light, I can use it to rework that crimson blade.~
@221 = ~A gemstone of pure light.... rather impressive ye be in the art of adventurin'.  With this and 5,000 gold pieces, I can reforge yer blade.~
@222 = ~Ah, ye've got a nicely balanced old fighter's blade here, seen alot of use.... ye would like it reforged?~
@223 = ~Aye, I can reforge this blade for ye, I would need something to give it a bit more pep... a gemstone of light would to the trick.~
@224 = ~This be a gemstone of brilliant light alright, I can use this to reforge that fighter's blade of yours, it would set ye back a mere 5,000 gold coins and a day's worth of yer help at me forge.~
@225 = ~Ah, the Kara-Turan blade of legend again, eh?  Ye say ye would like it enhanced further?~
@226 = ~Aye, I can enhance it, but an unearthly blade requires unearthly ore to reforge.  Nothing less than starfall ore would do the trick.~
@227 = ~This ore certainly be of unearthly origin, I can use this to reforge that red katana of yours.  A simple 10,000 golden coins from your coffers would seal the deal.~
@228 = ~The Severance +3?  A blade this well balanced be tough to enhance any further....~
@229 = ~If'n ye can somehow find me some ore from the heavens, I can reforge yer blade with it.~
@230 = ~Aye, this be ore from the stars alright, I can use it to enhance that old fighter's blade of yers.  I would just need 10,000 gold pieces and a day's worth of yer help at me forge.~
@231 = ~What's this now? Some scales from a black dragon?  Good on ye fer stickin' the wicked beast.~
@232 = ~These be some impressively tough scales, I can make ye a lightweight suit of scale armor, a suit of heavy plate, a protective helmet, or even a sturdy shield with these.~
@233 = ~Scales from a black dragon?  I can use these to further enhance your armor.~
@234 = ~The Verdant Crimson Dragonscale?  Ye wish to improve it further, eh?~
@235 = ~The Verdant Shadow Dragon Plate?  Ye wish to improve it further, eh?~
@236 = ~What've ye here?  A morningstar forged by an Ilmateran priest?  Surely to be blessed by the crying god himself, eh?~
@237 = ~Aye, I can improve it for ye.  I would need a gemstone fitting for the crying god, a king's tear, and a scroll of champion's strength to empower it.~
@238 = ~Ah, this be a tear of kings alright, and the champion's strength scroll as well.  I can get to work on that morningstar for ye right away, if'n ye can part with a mere 3,000gp for the work.~
@239 = ~Ilusarian's blessed morningstar again eh?  Ye wish it further enhanced?~
@240 = ~It be a challenge to improve it further, but me granda would surely strike at me from the grave if'n I could'nt, hah!  If ye come across a crystallized tear from a nymph in yer travels, I can use it to enhance yer morningstar.~
@241 = ~A crystallized nymph's tear... rarer than hen's teeth, but sure enough, ye have one here.  If ye can part with a mere 5,000 gold, I can get to work on fitting it to yer morningstar.~
@242 = ~Hmmm, a ring of oak?  Seems to have a bit 'o enchantment to it, but needs a stone set in 'er to be complete.~
@243 = ~I can complete this oaken ring of yers if'n ye can find me an elemental gemstone, or a Nymph's Tear to set into it.~
@244 = ~Ahh, it appears ye have a gem here I can use for yer oaken ring.~
@245 = ~I can use the Heart of Flame to complete your oaken ring.~
@246 = ~I can use the Breath of Wind to complete your oaken ring.~
@247 = ~I can use the Eye of Ichor to complete your oaken ring.~
@248 = ~I can use the Soul of Frost to complete your oaken ring.~
@249 = ~Ye must have a miner's spirit in ye to have found stones such as these, I can use any of them to complete yer oaken ring.~
@250 = ~It'll take a day's worth of your help at me forge, and a mere 5,000 gold for the commission.~
@251 = ~What've ye here now?  Looks to be one of those enchanted crossbow bolts I heard about from the battle at Dragonspear.   Talk around the docks is there be a surplus of these from the war that found their way to Athkatla.  Bloodscalp's work I'd wager, heh.~
@252 = ~Ye want these enhanced?  Tymora be your lady <CHARNAME>, I've been wanting to get me mitts on these new bolts and work with 'em.  If'n ye can find and bring me no less than forty each of bolts of fire +1 and bolts of ice +1, I can reforge them into something more potent.~
@253 = ~Aye, ye've enough bolts here for me to work with.  If ye can part with 1,000 gold crowns, I'll get to work on 'em right away.~
@254 = ~What be this ye have here?  Looks to be a shell from a remorhaz, pretty rare in these parts to be sure.~
@255 = ~Taerom once told me about a rather impressive helm he made from one of these shells.  I could make for ye such a helm, may even save yer hide if ye get into a scrap with some of those cowled wizards, heh.  6,000 gold coins be the cost for the work, what say ye?~
@256 = ~Now then, this certainly be a unique piece ye have here, a cursed blade from the Abyss, is it?  If'n I didn't know better, I'd say ye went and accepted a gift from some devil and reaped the rewards, heh!~
@257 = ~Aye, I believe I can repair this abyssal blade for ye, would take some special ore though.  I'd need some abyssal bloodiron to reforge the broken blade, and a scroll of remove curse to lift the curse the hell-beast placed on it, else the blade would just break again.~
@258 = ~This be the ore alright, and ye've the scroll as well.  Now just the matter of my commission.  5,000 gold and I'll forge ye a blade guaranteed never to break again.~
@259 = ~Ye wish more power from your bloodiron blade ye say?~
@260 = ~*ponders for a moment.........*

Aye, I believe I can do it, but I will need the infernal blood of a demon lord, nothing less.  If ye can manage to wrest some from one of the hell-beasts, bring it to me and we can use it to temper yer blade.~
@261 = ~Ye have some blood from a demon lord?  Well then, ye certainly be a fearless one, <CHARNAME>.  If'n ye can manage to part with 10,000 gold for the work, I'll get started on 'er.~
@262 = ~The reforged demon's gift?  Ye would like even more power from it, aye?~
@263 = ~*bellows in laughter*

<CHARNAME>, there are limits to even what ol' Cromwell can do.  Empowering this damned blade any further would take something on the order of magnitude of an eye from the demon prince himself!~
@264 = ~*stares in disbelief for a moment.......*

By the Soul Forger!!! I see it but I still cannae believe it.....  An eye from the Demogorgon!~
@265 = ~<CHARNAME>, I would be honored to set this eye in your demon's blade.  This be on the house, nay any commission required.  Once word gets out that this dwarf forged an artifact from the demon prince's eye, my forge will be worked non-stop till the end of me days to be certain.~
@266 = ~A shame it be.  I'll be here if'n ye change yer mind.~
@267 = ~Ah, the Sharran priestess' blade.  Has it been serving ye well enough?  No?  Ye wish it more powerful?  Hmmmmm... 

*spins his hammer in one hand while pondering*

.......aye, it may be possible to enhance further.~
@268 = ~I wager that If'n ye can find a gemstone of shadow, one imbued with energies from the Shadow Plane, the new hilt would accept it as a pommel stone and bring it to it's fullest potential.  I've nary an idea where ye would find such a thing though, maybe in the very plane of shadows itself.~
@269 = ~*closely inspects the Imbued Shadow Gem*

Aye, this'll do for a pommel gem, I can feel the presence of shadow just holding this stone.  I'll need 7,500 gold crowns fer tha' work, and I can get started right away if ye wish.~
@270 = ~.~
@271 = ~.~
@272 = ~.~
@273 = ~Ah, looks like ye may have a stone of two here I can use.~
@274 = ~Ah, the Heart of Flame.  I can use this to enhance this dagger o' yers.~
@275 = ~Ah, the Eye of Ichor.  I can use this to enhance this dagger o' yers.~
@276 = ~Ah, the Breath of Wind.  I can use this to enhance this dagger o' yers.~
@277 = ~Ah, the Soul of Frost.  I can use this to enhance this dagger o' yers.~
@278 = ~Ye've gone and found some elemental gems, I can use any of these to enhance yer dagger.~
@279 = ~Ye say ye would like the Maelstrom Axe further empowered?~
@280 = ~Aye, it be simple enough work, but I'd need an elemental gemstone of water to coax it out of 'er.~
@281 = ~This be an elemental gem of water, sure enough.  I can use this to enhance yer hand axe.  If'n ye can part with 7,500 gold crowns, I'll get started right away.~
@282 = ~Ye say ye would like the Maelstrom Pike further empowered?~
@283 = ~This be an elemental gem of water, sure enough.  I can use this to enhance yer halberd.  If'n ye can part with 7,500 gold crowns, I'll get started right away.~
@284 = ~I can use the Body of Water to complete your oaken ring.~
@285 = ~This be a nice enough scimitar ye have here, well balanced, and the magnificent sheen of the blade ia akin to sunrise over the sea...  Ye say you would like it enhanced?~
@286 = ~Aye, it can certainly be done, keep a keen eye towards an elemental gemstone in yer travels, specifically one of water.  Bring that, and 7,500 gold coins back to me forge, and I'll fix that blade up right-quick.~
@287 = ~This be the gemstone I need, sure enough.  And ye've the gold as well.  Shall we get started?~
@288 = ~Hmmmm, nice, bright shield ye got here.  Blessed by the Morninglord is it?~
@289 = ~It can be improved, aye, with the right components.  I believe we can make this shield shine like the very sun itself if you can bring me a holy symbol of the forgotten Amaunator.~
@290 = ~Ah, this is most certainly a holy symbol of the old sun god.  I would just need 3,500 gold fer the commission, and the help of your sword-arm for a day at me forge to rework your shield.~
@291 = ~Your calmishite saber?  Aye, I believe I can enhance it further for ye.~
@292 = ~I can make this speedy saber burn through foes even faster with an elemental gemstone of fire.  If'n ye come across one while spelunkin' ruins or some such, bring it back to me shop.~
@293 = ~This is an elemental gemstone of fire alright, I can use this to enhance yer saber.  It would cost ye 7,500gp for me efforts.~
@294 = ~Ahh, now this holy blade be a rare piece indeed, my friend.  I've heard tales of a lass weilding a sword like this at Dragonspear...  Ye would like it enhanced?~
@295 = ~I can reforge and strengthen it with some illithium ore, If'n ye can manage to find any not already claimed by one of the holier-than-thou types from the temple district.~
@296 = ~Ye have all the illithium we need here, now just the matter of me commission.  A simple sum of 8,000gp and I will make this holy blade truly shine for ye.~
@297 = ~The holy blade of the Asters?   Not an easy task to improve it further, but certainly not impossible....~
@298 = ~I need a gemstone filled with holy power, the legendary Eye of Tyr would work.  Problem is finding it, heh.  But that's something for an adventurer like yerself to solve.  Find it and bring it back to me shop, and I'll create a blade that will make the beasties flee from the sight of it.~
@299 = ~*Rolls the Eye of Tyr around in his palm*

Bloody hells... this is the Eye of Tyr, to be sure.  If ye can see to part with 8,000 gold coins, I will fit this to yer holy longsword.~
@300 = ~Really nice piece of paladin's headgear ye have here friend, such a sad story behind it.  Ye would like it enhanced?~
@301 = ~Aye, I can improve upon this circlet for ye.  I would need a couple of ioun stones of wisdom, one of silver and one of incandescent blue would make this legendary helm a true boon to those who specialize in the divine.~
@302 = ~*tosses the silver and incandescent blue ioun stones in the air and catches both in a single swipe*

These two stones are perfect for yer circlet.  I only need 5,000gp for the commission, and your help at me forge for the day.~
@303 = ~The craftsmanship on this shield is magnificient, rivals some of me own work, heh.  You want it improved, aye?~
@304 = ~We can improve this angelic shield of yers.  Find and bring me a pearly white ioun stone and some elven holy water, and I'll set to work on 'er.~
@305 = ~Ahh, ye've the stone and holy water I need here.  Now just the matter of me commission.  3,500 gold coins, what ye say?~
@306 = ~Nice handiwork on this chain, appears to be of elven make, and has some years of use to it, to be sure.~
@307 = ~I can rework this blessed chainmail by reinforcing it with plates, but I'll need a special metal to do it justice.  I've heard tales of ore from the heavens itself.  If ye find some of this starfall ore, I can use it to enhance your hallowed mail.~
@308 = ~Ah, spectacular sheen to this ore ye brought me, surely this must be from the heavens.  I can use this to forge you a suit of plate fit for the pure of heart.  5,000gp for me commission and it's a done deal.~
@309 = ~Looks here like ye've been exterminating some eight-legged vermin recently.  Good on ye!  I cannae stand the creepers meself, but I can craft ye a nice garment from the silks if ye have enough.~
@310 = ~I'll need four swaths of giant spider silks to have enough to weave into a protective garment for ye, it'll be light enough even for an acrobat, hah!~
@311 = ~Ye've got enough silk here, all that remains is me commission.  3,500 gold and I can start immediately for ye.~
@312 = ~*swings the Blazing Glory +3 about*

This morningstar has surely seen it's share of battles, aye?  I can almost hear the beat of war drums just by holding it.~
@313 = ~Enhance this morningstar?  Aye, I can do it for ye, I'll need a few things tae do it.  A wand of the heavens, a scroll of flame strike, and an elemental gemstone of fire.  Bring me these and I will reforge yer morningstar into a weapon fit for Tempus himself.~
@314 = ~Ye've all I need here to reforge this morningstar of battles.  If ye can spare a day's worth of yer help at me forge and 7,500 gold coins, we can seal the deal.~
@315 = ~Aye, ye've collected the scales of a shadow dragon. By the Soul Forger, 'tis a grand sight.  I'm sure the deathly beast waylaid many an adventurer before ye came along, no doubt.  I can make ye a fine suit of heavy plate, lightweight scale, a protective helm, or even a sturdy shield from yon scales, if ye like.~
@316 = ~Ah! Scales from a red dragon, a beast of the Dread Flame.  I can make ye an exquisite suit of heavy plate, lightweight scale, a protective helm, or even a sturdy shield.  Do any of these hold yer interest?~
@317 = ~Fair enough, what else?~
@318 = ~'Tis a pity, anything else?~
@319 = ~I can use the Nypmh's Tear to complete your oaken ring.~
@320 = ~Ah, bloody hells, these be scales of a noble silver dragon!  Tell me ya dinnae slay one yerself to get these?  Bah, it be no matter of import, we surely aren't going to let these go to waste!~
@321 = ~I can forge for ye a truly magnificent suit of heavy plate, lightweight scale armor, a sturdy shield, or a protective helm from these scales.  Ye will be protected by any of them well enough, though some folk will look down upon ye fer wearing it, heh.~
@322 = ~I would need 5,000 gold coins and yer help at me forge.  That lazy Duergar apprentice of mine refuses to return to work.  *spits*~
@323 = ~Another scale from a beastie, aye?  Ye be proficent at slayin the wily creatures, to be sure.~
@324 = ~Ye've here the scales of a white dragon, still cold to the touch!  I can forge for ye a splendid suit of heavy plate, lightweight scale armor, a sturdy shield, or even a protective helm from yon scales.  Any of those pique yer interest?~
@325 = ~A mere 5,000 gold coins, and yer strong arm at me bellows again for the day.  What say ye?~
@326 = ~Ah, ye've some scales of a great blue dragon here, a terrible thunder lizard to be sure.  Must still have some electrical charge left in these, the hair on me arm be standing up straight just from holding 'em.~
@327 = ~From these azure scales, I can forge for ye an exquisite suit of heavy plate, light scale armor, sturdy shield, or a protective helmet, what say ye?~
@328 = ~5,000 gold pieces and a day's worth of time at me forge to complete the work.~
@329 = ~Ey?  I know this hammer... it once belonged to that rat-bastard Durn Coldhearth.  Betrayed his clan, and if that wasn't bad enough, made a deal with a lich to become one himself!~
@330 = ~Improve Coldhearth's hammer?  Aye, certainly possible.  I would need an artifact from a powerful lich, a tooth would work best.  Bring one to me shop and I will reforge your traitor's hammer with it's power.~
@331 = ~Ye've got a lich's tooth?  One from a drow lich, no less.  This will work for your hammer.  5,000 gold pieces to seal the deal and I will get started on it.~
@332 = ~Ah, yer corrosive dagger again eh?  Ye wish it more powerful?~
@333 = ~It would take a mighty powerful gem to enhance this dagger further.  Bring me the Eye of Ichor and 5,000gp, and I'll reforge yer dagger into the finest ye've seen.~
@334 = ~Ah, this is the Eye of Ichor alright, and will do nicely.   Ye've the gold as well, it seems.  Shall I get started?~
@335 = ~What've ye brought me here.... Ah, a battle axe from the Ice Dragon Berserker Lodge, quite rare in these parts.~
@336 = ~Hmmm, hard to improve on this axe, but anything is possible, with the right components.  To improve upon this axe, I will need a wand of frost, a scroll of ice storm, and most importantly, the legendary Frostreaver.~
@337 = ~Excellent!  Ye've found the Frostreaver, and ye've the scroll and wand here too.  A simple matter of 10,000 gold coins for me commission and I'll reforge yer beserker axe into something special.~
@338 = ~The Blizzard Axe, has she been serving ye well?  Improved ye say?  Hmmm...~
@339 = ~Yes, there be a way, only one.  An elemental gemstone of coldest ice, the Soul of Frost.  If ye find it in yer travels, bring it back to me shop.~
@340 = ~I felt the chill as soon as ye entered, ye've found the Soul of Frost.  For a mere 5,000 crowns I will use this to bring the full force of winter to yer axe.~ 
@341 = ~Ah, ye've got a nice bear pelt here, good quality if I do say so meself.~
@342 = ~I can make a fine pair of boots out of this pelt for ye.  Any dwarf worth his salt knows the value of a good pair of boots, some of us even consider them lucky, heh.  2,000 gold, ye interested?~
@343 = ~Ey, I know this hammer, Lady Ashideena's namesake!  Such fine craftsmanship and history behind this one.~
@344 = ~I can reforge this hammer into something that would make Lady Ashideena proud, I just need a few things from ye.  I will need ye to bring me a wand of lightning, a scroll of lightning bolt, and most importantly, I'll need ye to find and bring me Borok's Fist.~
@345 = ~Ye've everything I need to reforge Ashideena, a simple manner of my comission is all that remains.  5,000 gold pieces, no less.  Shall we begin?~

@1248 = ~I can finishes human skin-armor into something much wonderful for you master, I would just need an old lich robe... like maybe... Vecna's?  Oh and human flesh skin must be cured with bloods.  Dragon bloods...Shadow Dragon bloods to be specific for best result.  And don't forget the gold shinys! 10,000 to be precise!~
@1249 = ~Master is truly the great one if <PRO_HESHE> can gets ahold of both Vecna robe and nasty Shadow Dragon bloods. Shall loyal butler get to work on fixing up human skin-flesh for you?~
@1250 = ~Well, if the master isn't going to use human flesh-skin, can Cespenar use to make new coat?  Or maybe jerky-beef?  No?  Master is sooo stingy sometimes......~
@1251 = ~What now?  The master wants the Lich's Raiment improved even mores?~
@1252 = ~I dont know if I has... wait...wait.......maybe, just maybe.  Yes, I can makes it even better!  But Cespenar would need a relic of very dark magic... like a skull from a lich~
@1253 = ~The master is truly astounding... this is definitely an empowered lich's skull.  If the master can part with a measly sum of 10,000 golds, I will get to work on reforging human-skin-armor right away.~
@1254 = ~Truly?  Master, I would highly recommend using skull for ashtray then.  Teeths can hold all forms of smoke-device for you, trust me!  No messes for butler to clean!~
@1255 = ~What you has this time, Master?  Smells like moldy socks... but is sealed scroll?  Must be something reaallly important inside...~
@1256 = ~Very tricksy recipe to open sealed scroll, would needs some bloods from stinky dragon.  Any dragon's blood would do.~
@1257 = ~Cespenar can use dragon bloods you has here to remove seal from musty old scroll.~
@1258 = ~I can uses this dragon's blood to unseal old scroll for you.~
@1259 = ~I can uses this shadow dragon's blood to unseal old scroll for you.~
@1260 = ~I can uses this silver dragon's blood to unseal old scroll for you.~
@1261 = ~deprecated~
@1262 = ~deprecated~
@1263 = ~deprecated~
@1264 = ~So much icky bloods from old nasty lizards, the master sure knows how to put those big bullies in their place!~
@1265 = ~I would just need icky bloods and 5,000 gold shinys.~
@1266 = ~No then?  Well, maybe you thinks Cespenar can use for to add to collection?~
@1267 = ~Such shiny red blade this is, is red from blood of enemies?  Cespenar sure hopes so...~
@1268 = ~You would like for loyal butler to improves crimson blade for you?  I can do, but would need something most untasteful... gemstone of yucky light.~
@1269 = ~You has light-stone here, I can uses this with 5,000 gold shinys to improves crimson blade for you.~
@1270 = ~Okay then, no on crimson blade, what else you has for me to look at?~

@1272 = ~Loyal butler can improve fighter-sword for you, I would needs icky gemstone of light and 5,000 shiny golds.~
@1273 = ~You has the light gem here, and the golds, should I get to work on fighter-sword for you, master?~
@1274 = ~No then?  Do you have other shinys for me to look through?~
@1275 = ~Master would like red dawn-blade enhanced further?  Hmmm...  Might have a recipe for that.~
@1276 = ~To reforge dawn-blade, I will needs metal from sky, not sure how you would get that...~
@1277 = ~You found sky-metal!  I can use to enhance red katana for you, I just needs 10,000 golds for complete the recipe.~
@1278 = ~Oh alright then.. was looking forward to using sky-metal, never got to work with that before.  What else do you has for me?~
@1279 = ~You would likes your fighter-sword improved further?  That's a tought one, even for me....~
@1280 = ~Cespenar does have recipe, just one, needs star-metal ore to reforge sword for you.~
@1281 = ~You gots star-metal?  Did the master pluck it from the sky?   Well, since you has ore, I can use with 10,000 gold shinys to enhance fighter-sword for you.~
@1282 = ~No?  Shucks... well what else you has for me?~
@1283 = ~More scales from nasty dragonses?  Black ones this time?  Master must dislike dragons as much as Cesepenar!~
@1284 = ~Black scaleses are extra tough!  Cespenar can use to make shield, light scale armor, or heavy plate armor for the master.~
@1285 = ~I can use these black dragon scales to remakes stinky dragon hide armor for the master.~
@1286 = ~Ouch! Cespenar stuck fingers on prickly crying god morningstar.  Master wants me to improve?~
@1287 = ~I can makes Ilmater weapon better with a king's tear and a champion's strength scroll.~
@1288 = ~Master has the scroll and king gem here, I just needs 3,000 of your shiniest golds to complete recipe.~
@1289 = ~No go?  Just as well, never liked crybaby god anyway.  What else you has for me?~
@1290 = ~Oh no, not silly crybaby morningstar again......  The master would like it enhanced more?~
@1291 = ~Loyal butler has a recipe for that.... but needs something rare, a crystallized tear from nymphs.~
@1292 = ~Ooooh... such sweet sorrow in this tear...It's deliciously palpable!  I can use to empower Ilmater weapon for you, I just needs 5,000 golds to get started.~
@1293 = ~Nope?  Does master have other shinys and trinkets for me to look through?~
@1294 = ~Ring made of wood?  Ladyfriend would think Cespenar is big time cheapskate if I tries to gives her something like this...~
@1295 = ~I has ancient druid's recipe for wood ring, I would just needs gemstone of elements to make complete.~
@1296 = ~I can uses Heart of Flame gem to complete ring.~
@1297 = ~I can uses Eye of Ichor gem to complete ring.~
@1298 = ~I can uses Breath of Wind gem to complete ring.~
@1299 = ~I can uses Soul of Frost gem to complete ring.~
@1300 = ~Wow.... master has nice rock collection here, much better than mine, I can use any of these to complete wood ring.~
@1301 = ~Hoookay... we keeps 'em seperated then.~
@1302 = ~You haves stuff for old druid recipe. Good recipe, too. Heartwood Ring... needs oaken ring, and a nymph's tear or elements gem.~
@1303 = ~I just needs the stone and 5,000 of your shiniest golds.~
@1304 = ~Hmmm... bolt that burns... I heard about these in Avernus.  Some mean guys from Baldur's Gate had them when they re-sealed the portal!  Wait... you weren't involved in that, were you, Master?~
@1305 = ~Hmmm... bolt that freezes... I heard about these in Avernus.  Some mean guys from Baldur's Gate had them when they re-sealed the portal!  Wait... you weren't involved in that, were you, Master?~
@1306 = ~Cespenar has a recipe for frosty-fire bolts, I just needs forty of each, icy-bolt and firey-bolt.  Oh, can't forget golds, I needs 1,000 of those.~
@1307 = ~Master has everything I needs to make better bolts, should I make them for you now?~
@1308 = ~Maybe just use for toothpicks instead then, do you have other shinys for me to look through?~
@1309 = ~What's this?  Giant ugly bug shell?  Looks like a mean one...~
@1310 = ~I can makes a nice helmet for the master with this shell, I would needs 6,000 gold shinys for the recipe though...~
@1311 = ~No?  Can Cespenar use for soup bowl then?  I has gazpacho recipe that would be perfect for.~
@1312 = ~What's this? crappy broken blade?  must be of poor manufacture...  looks like Xhost's work.~
@1313 = ~I can fixes broken demon blade for the great one.  Needs abyssal bloodiron ores and scroll of remove curse to keeps it from breaking again.~
@1314 = ~Yes, this is enough ore to work with and you has the scroll too.  Now I needs 5,000 shinies of gold to complete my recipe.~
@1315 = ~No then?  Are you sure?  Maybe you can find Xhost and ask for refund.~
@1316 = ~The master would likes for restored demon sword to be more powerful?~
@1317 = ~Demon weapons are Cespenar's specialty!  I would need icky bloods from a demon lord to temper sword in.  Demon lords are extra mean, and their bloods make for extra power!~
@1318 = ~Ooohh, yes master this is the bloods I need for your sword.  Now all that's left is 10,000 golds shinies to make my recipe completes!~
@1319 = ~Hmmph, well can Cespenar use blood for drink mix maybe?  Could make one mean bloody mary!  *cackles*~
@1320 = ~Great one would like for demon sword to have even *more* power?~
@1321 = ~Cespenar dooooes have one recipe for that, but very scary it is.  Would require eyeball from demon prince!  He is very, very mean one!~
@1322 = ~You has the prince's eyeball?  <CHARNAME> is surely worthy of being called the Great One!   Still requires gold shinies though, always requires shinies.  I need 10,000 of them to puts eye in demon sword.~
@1323 = ~Really?  Oh, ok then, um... other shinies you want me to look at for you?~
@1324 = ~Master must really like this darkness sword to keep bringing it to Cespenar...~
@1325 = ~Of course loyal butler can makes it stronger, but needs something hard to find, most rare indeed.  Needs shadow gemstone, but not just any, must be imbued with shadow magics!~
@1326 = ~Wow!  Where did you find this rock?  I can feels shadows surging within.  Yes, this will most certainly work for your dark sword.  Along with 7,500 shiny golds, of course.~
@1327 = ~Maybe dark enough as is, then.  What else can Cespenar look at for you?~
@1328 = ~Nice one here! Has gem of flame!  Cespenar's favorite!  I can uses this to enhance dagger for you.~
@1329 = ~Hmmm, you has gem of ichor here, nice one, but not favorite.  I can uses this to enhance your dagger, master.~
@1330 = ~Gem of wind?  S'ok I guess.  I can uses to enhance elements dagger.~

@1336 = ~Yes! Cespenar can do, but needs special gem.  Elemental water gem, and 7,500 golds to finish recipe.~
@1337 = ~You has water gem here, and golds, all I needs to reforge stormy axe for you, shall I completes?~
@1338 = ~Not now?  Maybe later then, what more you has for me to look at?~
@1339 = ~The master would like <PRO_HISHER> pike of maelstroms to have more power?~
@1340 = ~You has water gem here, and golds, all I needs to reforge stormy pike for you, shall I completes?~

@1342 = ~What's this?  Sword made of water?  Won't last long down here.....~
@1343 = ~Might can make wet sword better with elemental water gem.   If master finds one, brings back to me and will try new recipe.~
@1344 = ~This water gem I can use for your sword, I needs 7,500 shiny golds to complete recipe.~

@1348 = ~Oh yes!  This is symbol from sun-god.  Can the master provide 3,500 shinys to complete recipe?~
@1349 = ~Maybe leave bright shield at home next time then? Completely ruins feng-shuei in here.~
@1350 = ~Genie blade again?  Fast enough, but not hot enough?  Hmmmm....~
@1351 = ~Of course!  Needs elemental gem of fire, then genie blade burns much better!  If master finds one <PRO_HESHE> should bring it back here.~
@1352 = ~Cespenar can use gemstone you have here to enhance genie blade, needs 7,500 golds to complete recipe.~
@1353 = ~Maybe we can rub on and make three wishes then?  No?  Only works on lamps.... rats!~
@1354 = ~Ohh, this sword is really shiny one..... Wait, where you get this, master?  There was really mean lady in Avernus that had sword just like this one.... wonder what ever happened to her?~
@1355 = ~Yes indeed, Cespenar has recipe for this one.  Needs some *really* shiny ore though, illithium.  I not sures where you could finds some, but if you does, I can use to reforge shining blade with.~
@1356 = ~You has illithium ore!  I can use to reforge shining lady-blade.  Only 8,000 golds to complete the recipe.~
@1357 = ~Nope?  Maybe better to hang on wall for trophy.~
@1358 = ~You wants shining lady-blade enhanced again?   Phew, still exhausted from last time....~
@1359 = ~I would needs a *really* shiny stone of holy powers for upgrade, Eye of Tyr?  Yes, that would work! If you finds, bring to loyal butler and I use for your sword.~

Phew! this armor stinks like crusader!  Great One wishes it reforged?~
@1371 = ~Suuuuure... I has recipe for this, needs special ore from stars and 5,000 gold shinies.~
@1372 = ~Ooooh, sparkly star ore you has here.  I can use to reforge smelly crusader armor into much better plate.  I get started for you?~
@1373 = ~Alrighty then, what else?~

Please, take this as a token of our unending gratitude.  A disconsolate skald with an insatiable penchant for drink and women left it behind when he came through some months ago.  He was not a good fit for our troupe, but perhaps his helmet will be as such for you.~ [RAELIS21]

@8006 = ~High Watcher Oisig was correct in recommending you. You are an asset to Helm. I thank you on behalf of the Morninglord.  Please, take this shield as a token of our gratitude, it is from the ancient family of Egon and will serve you well in your travels.~

@8008 = ~And now they are to be married... what wonderful news. Thank you again, my <LADYLORD>. I cannot express my gratitude enough for everything you have done here.  Before you came to Trademeet, I had purchased these for my son, thinking they would help him if he were to run off foolhardily after Raissa.  Thanks to you, he didn't have to, and I believe my <LORDLADY>ship would find them most useful.~
@8009 = ~Yes, thank you so much. *sniff* Please, take this as a token of our thanks for bringing peace to our son.  It was to be a gift for him, and I can no longer bear to look at it.  Come, my husband... let us go home.~
@8010 = ~As I knew you would be.  For your first reward in my service, I offer this armor.  This one sought to usurp me in ages past.  I can think of no better fate for him as you cut a bloody swath across Faerûn in my name.~

Please, take these old boots, I'll not need them anymore as after this, I am quite done with adventuring. Thank you once again, I will speak kind of your name to all whom ask!~
@8013 = ~<CHARNAME>! I have received news that you have cleared out the Firewine Bridge ruins! No longer will kobolds plague our tiny village. I must congratulate you on a job well done. Everyone is grateful for your help. Take these boots I found exploring the ruins long ago as a show of our gratitude.~
@8014 = ~And what if it was? It is not of my making. I myself was once a resident for a time. It tends to snag passing teleporting mages from time to time. I left my magics and gadgets and was able to use some minor incantations to escape. Passive resistance is more successful when the very ground seems to drag magic to it. The others might find their release if they lose the anger and attachment to their toys. Ah, I will not argue this with you, the place was not of my making. You have done well enough to earn this. Goodbye.~
@8015 = ~You return. You are proven capable, at least in this respect. Certainly you have the will to change your personal ways as well. We are square and fair, for the moment. I cannot guarantee that we will remain so, however, as your kind is to be scrutinized closely. Rather a nonexistent short-term memory as well, I'm afraid. You have done me a favor, now do yourself one. Behave yourself until you are of positive standing in the community, and take this, I've no longer any need for it. Begone.~
@8016 = ~Surely it cannae be?  Is that shimmering piece o' carapace ye have there from a Remorhaz?  How did ye manage to find such a horrid beast in these parts, much less slay it?!  No matter, if ye are willing to part with it, I will happily pay a tidy sum of 2,000 gold for it.  When I was but a wee lad, I once saw a fearsome helmet made from a remorhaz shell and I would like to try me own hand at making one.~
@8017 = ~Ah, this will make a right-kingly helm, may even turn aside a spell or two.  Something this exotic may even draw the eye of Entar Silvershield, heh!  I thank you, <CHARNAME>. My smithy will surive this iron shortage yet.~
@8018 = ~Hells, a terrible shame. To work with something so exotic and rare would have been a real pleasure, and bring much needed coin to my smithy.  Hmmm, <CHARNAME>, an offer for ye, if you'll hear it.  For 6,000 gold, I will make a fine helm with it for you.  Less than my usual fare for such a piece, but I could use the work.~
@8019 = ~Ye be short on gold?  Since your party is obviously battle-hardened enough to slay a remorhaz, ye may want to try your luck in exploring the ruins of Durlag's tower.  It be a deadly place, for sure, but such places tend to be rich in artifacts and gold as well.~
@8020 = ~Then a deal is struck!  Curing and working with such material will take some time, but once finished, you will have a helm that even the grand dukes would envy.  Come back after five days, and it will be ready for you.~
@8021 = ~Only for you, <CHARNAME>.~
@8022 = ~Ah, you have returned. And here be the helm I promised you. Enchanting, isn't it? A finer helmet I've never made. Wear it well.~
@8023 = ~A tickle more running than I care to do in a dragon's age! Such is the way o' the nightsneak, but not another profession pays as well. Ye be quite the force under the weight o' pursuit, grabbin' the pretties while hoofin' it fast! Ye prove to me an' brethren all that ye be here for good reason. Here be yer reward, ye've earned it, and tonight we'll suck the monkey a keg apiece tavern wise!~

If you have any of my other possessions, come talk to me again.~

@8039 = ~I care nothing for the drow war on the surface elves, and I spit on Phaere and her House. I can give this extra copy of the eggs to you to foil her plans, and should things go awry, take this cloak as well.  I took it from some foolish Duergar who attempted to ambush me in the tunnels.~

Moments after they left, the unicorn stepped softly to the bard and extended its horn. The bard grasped the horn weakly and, to her astonishment, it came away in her hand. The bard sat up, healed of all wounds and bestowed with a valuable gift. The unicorn vanished into the trees, and the bard found the horn bestowed healing powers whenever she played it.

One of the drinkers in the tavern, an old woman, stood up midway through the performance and snapped, "You think it clever to insult and belittle others? Do so, then, for as long as you live!"

He requested Cromwell to forge him a suit of armor made from the shells so that he could return home to face the shopkeeper-mage who had betrayed his neighbors.  Unfortunately, the fishmonger could not afford the commission.  Not wanting to send away someone in such dire need, Cromwell agreed to make the armor if the fishmonger would allow him to keep a small portion of shell for himself.  Cromwell then used the shell to forge a new helmet for himself, as he knew it would provide greater protection against magical misfires at his forge.   No one knows what ever happened to the fishmonger or the unique suit of Remorhaz armor, it is most likely he was waylaid by bandits on his return trip and the armor stolen.

After arriving in Athkatla, the djinn quickly fled from her docked ship into the first domicile she could find,  which happened to be Cromwell's shop.  After explaining her situation and pleading for help, Cromwell agreed to perform a dangerous and rare enchantment on the djinn's lamp to reverse the relationship between master and servant.  Once he caught up to her, the enfuriated Vizier immediately used his powerful magics to wrest the lamp from the djinn.  In his haste, he immediately rubbed the lamp to trap the djinn.  Much to his dismay, he was drawn into the lamp against his will, imprisoning himself and freeing the djinn.  The grateful djinn gifted this hammer to Cromwell before returning to Calimshan.  Over the years, Cromwell has used this hammer to forge many powerful magic items, and its power has grown as magics continue to seep slowly into it from his works.  None know what happend to the accursed lamp containing the eil Vizier, but it is said to be somewhere at the bottom of the trackless sea.

At the next lecture, the pupil stood up and shouted, "I won't listen to you any longer!" To his horror, no sound issued from his throat.

He favored purple clothing, believing it was a color the god preferred, and he crafted this belt to match his ensemble. The thief was eventually caught and killed on one of his missions and the belt confiscated by the city guard. The next night, the belt vanished from a locked chest in the guardhouse, though, whisked away by Mask so that it could continue to serve the god's ends.

Unfortunately—and it took Mosela only a few short days to discover this—Listrom knew more about making the golems than he did about controlling them, and by the end of Mosela’s first week she realized that she would need some means of protecting herself. Thus was created this cudgel that, she hoped, would keep the misbehaving constructs at bay.

Illep was well liked by most people, but a human warrior named Brammel took offense to Illep's foppish manner in a tavern one night. Despite Illep's skill with daggers, the lithe rogue could do little to recover from the axe wound to the upper chest and neck that Brammel dealt him. Brammel was arrested by town guards, and the wand was to be returned to Illep's family in Myth Drannor. The small caravan transporting the wand was sacked by human bandits and disappeared from history.

Exceptions do exist, though such specialized items are rare at best.

@2474 = ~Lin Mei was described as a woman of exquisite beauty and a hellish temper. When her family urged her to find a husband, she issued a challenge to the men of the land: Whoever could make her yield in single combat could have her hand. The suitors gathered from all across Kara-Tur to test their skill, and although she fought with no weapons but her open hands, she bested every single one of them. Disappointed, all suitors left but one—a young man with kind eyes and a pair of gilded bracers, which he presented to her as a gift. "No one can hope to tame your passions," he said, "and those who would try will never understand your heart. May these trinkets serve as a reminder that your temper is your own and not to be controlled." Lin Mei did not marry that man, but she left home with him that day to seek adventure, and together they spent the rest of their lives in closer partnership than any husband and wife. Eventually the pair retired, and Lin Mei quietly disappeared from the annals of history. All that remains of her story are the bracers she wore, still burning with the fire of her untamed passion.

Yet when he discovered the merchant's gift, so the story goes, Sarutobi refused to wear the bracers, saying "I will crush this giant's skull with my bare hands, and I need no magic to help me do it!" Sarutobi carried the day, and the merchant locked the bracers away in his safe. When Sarutobi disappeared one day through a planar door, the merchant took the opportunity to give the bracers to Sarutobi's son, as small compensation for the loss of his father. The boy took the bracers and devoted his life to searching for his father. He never found him.

On another occasion, Bron's cowardly companions abandoned him when they were attacked by dire wolves in the wilderness. Two weeks later, Bron swaggered into their camp wearing wolfskins.

Kossuth appeared in a gigantic bonfire and did battle with the enormous supernatural beast. The god's avatar triumphed over the octopus, but the monster did manage to damage Kossuth's essence.

When he put on these robes, proud men stood aside and braggarts stilled their tongues. For all of Ogi-Luc's pride and prowess, he was unable to defeat the Red Wizard abjurer Nesk Vhaltim.

Elpham stole a pouch full of gems off of Xain's waist and danced off into the crowd shouting, "Why don't you try to chase me back to the Priador, baldy? Ha ha!"

Apali had killed the priest's great-great-grandfather in Chult over a hundred years earlier.

@2529 = ~Many stories have been told about Chief Geraq's rise to power within his tribe of Swivelback goblins. Some point to his talent for strategy, feeding his tribe for weeks on the spoils of a single raid, while others look to his knowledge of obscure lore. The truth is both less interesting and more: the source of Geraq's power was a strange stone, which the goblin carried everywhere he went. Where he found the stone is a mystery, as well as where it went after Geraq's mysterious disappearance, but holding it in one's hand, one can hear the whispers of Geraq's expertise sounding across the centuries. Of course, the whispers are all spoken in the language of goblins, making them more or less useless to the humanoid races; even so, the stone bestows greater knowledge on any who possess it.

@2549 = ~A wicked-looking dagger with a dark history, the Salamander's Tongue is prized both for its use as a weapon and its hidden magical powers. The blade appears to be an exotic-looking dagger with a kris-like wavy blade ending in two small points. A small portion of a slimy, bright-red living salamander's tongue is somehow embedded in the heart of the blade, near the grip. It pulses and writhes randomly without intervention from the owner. 

The exact origins of the blade are unknown, but it is believed that the first owner of the weapon was a respected and feared gnomish thief and assassin from Westgate named Turlam Shallowhill. Turlam was killed in a fight with a rival, a halfling called Deder Seven Fingers. Deder kept the weapon as a trophy, not knowing its powers until after it was stolen by an underling, a fellow halfling named Kreshinal Blackhound. Kreshinal fled to Selgaunt with the dagger for five years, relying on its powers to hide him from divination. Kreshinal lost the dagger in a botched gambling scam and was killed by Deder's agents within the month. Deder attempted to reclaim the dagger from the Sembian criminals who had captured it. He succeeded at routing the thieves and reclaiming his dagger, but he focused so much attention on the blade that he didn't notice that the Sembian criminals had employed a priest of Mask to infiltrate and break down his interests in Westgate. The ensuing war between the Westgate and Selgaunt factions ended when the priest of Mask, Pieter the Feeble, made the two sides so paranoid that they ate themselves away from the inside. Pieter grabbed the dagger when he had the opportunity and escaped to Hillsfar, confident that the unorganized demihuman supporters of the late Deder Seven Fingers wouldn't follow him to a place so hostile to their kind.

In yet another scam, Pieter sold the blade to a Mulmaster Hawk while luring other potential buyers to an auction in Hillsfar. Pieter and his associates murdered the buyers at the fake auction and made off with the cash, hiding under the cover of an amulet of non-detection. The Mulmaster Hawk who purchased the blade was supposedly killed by priestesses of Umberlee who were angry at the assassin's refusal to pay tribute to the Bitch Queen. Years of factional fighting between the Umberlants are believed to have transported the blade as much as three thousand miles away from its humble beginnings in Sembia. The whereabouts of Pieter the Feeble and his goons are currently unknown.

Unknown to her lovers, she would place a Ring of Readiness on the mace, saving the matching ring for a special time. When she grew tired of her consorts, as she always did, she would give the matching ring to a new lover and send the young man out to kill her old paramour. The new lover would simply call upon the ring and the mace would fly to his hand. 

Unfortunately, Redani was done in when she trusted the wrong man to kill her old lover. Gural of Chessenta, a well-disguised priest of Hoar, took it upon himself to gain vengeance for a man whose skull he had picked up by the side of a road. Unluckily for Redani, priests of Hoar will go to any length to avenge the dead, even if it means animating all of her dead lovers to tear her limb from limb.

At last the leader of the yuan-ti raiders faced off with the young woman, and although he did finally overpower her, he was astonished by her skill. The katana she carried was recovered and later enchanted by a high priest of Sseth. The once graceful blade was tainted by dark magic and now guides those who wield it to inflict the severest of wounds upon their enemies.

Kadan parted with the weapon, however, when he crossed paths with the infamous Nido Ochita Inazuma in western Faerûn. Inazuma was the son of a Cormyrean knight and a Kara-Turian noblewoman. He claimed that his mother was struck by lightning twice while she was pregnant with Inazuma—once when she learned she had conceived and again immediately before she gave birth. Legends say that Inazuma was born on the edge of the Fateful Coin, the mystical method by which Tymora and Beshaba decide whether a person will have good or bad luck throughout his or her life. Sages believe that Inazuma's coin landed on edge, making him immune to the effects of weal and woe. When he came across Kadan and his scimitar, it was only a matter of time before the Zakharan gambled his scimitar and his life into Inazuma's hands.

Danel's deeds are not as well known as those of many other heroic dwarves, but that is perhaps because his kingdom died with him. His nation suffered heavy losses when trolls and giants attacked it over a thousand years ago in the nearly forgotten "War of Curdling Blood." The war between the tribes of monsters and the kingdom of Silverrock was waged over fifteen years. Danel never attempted to flee his kingdom, seek the aid of neighboring countries, or abandon his people. Despite the fact that many of his subjects did indeed flee, Danel remained in Silverrock until the very end. Before the final battle of the terrible war, Danel told his people, "When ye see this plume on me head fall, I want ye to make sure that our people don't bow, like gold, but that they break, like iron." 

Almost as soon as the battle was joined, Danel charged to the front of the fray and leapt into the talons of a dozen trolls. The moment his plume disappeared from sight, every man, woman, and child remaining in Silverrock poured out of the fortified caverns and dragged down as many trolls and giants as they could. Barrels of flaming oil were dumped all over Danel's palace and the common areas of the city, consuming as many dwarves as trolls and terrible frost giants. In the end, the monsters had achieved a Pyrrhic victory. The dwarven city was a smoldering ruin from which little treasure, no slaves, and no food could be taken. Many trolls died of starvation that winter, and when they turned on their giant allies for sustenance, the entire army fell into disarray forever.

He carried this horn with him when he observed many titanic battles. The chief of his tribe gave him the instrument with instructions to blow it if he was ever in mortal danger. Beogin, too proud to ever call on his tribesmen for help, was killed in battle, the horn hidden under his cloak.

@2612 = ~Owain's Lullabye was created by a disturbed bard named Owain Piper. Piper was a worshipper of Auril, born in the town of Silverymoon and raised to embrace the frigid environment of his homeland. He traveled extensively in the Moonsea, where he met a mage named Pelham of the Moor. Owain and Pelham became good friends and stayed in contact for over a decade. Pelham eventually enchanted Owain's Lullabye for the bard in exchange for a small sum of money. Owain rarely used the instrument in battle, typically employing it when he found late-migrating geese lounging on a lake. He would blow the horn in such a way that the geese heard it as the sound of their cousins heading south for the winter. As the geese would attempt to take flight, Owain's horn would freeze them in mid-stroke, where he would leave them to die.

Memnon used the weapon very little, deigning to give it to a powerful lieutenant. When Memnon and Calim fell to elven high magic, their servants fled or were driven back to their home planes. It is believed that the Wind of Heaven found its way back into the hands of the djinn after the epic war.

STATISTICS:

Weight: 2~
@2647 = ~Found in the Dark Moon Heretic's temple, this hilt would appear to be forged to specifically conduct dark energies from the shadow plane into a weapon.  It's composition seems metallic, but it is unlike any ore or alloy commonly, or even uncommonly encountered, exhibiting properties that almost make it seem to be a living entity in and of itself.  The grip is soft to the touch and molds itself to the hand when held, but when struck against a hard surface becomes as rigid and tough as dragon's scale, almost as if it can anticipate the strike.  There are sockets for gemstones in the hilt, and when a stone of similar shape is pressed into one, the metal initally molds itself around the stone it similar to how it does the hand, but then withdraws, causing the stone to drop free.  It would seem that only a specific type of stone would be accepted into the socket.  Why this hilt was not completed into a weapon remains a mystery.  Perhaps the Sharrans were unable to find enough of this material to complete their work, or perhaps your involvement interrupted their plans.

This spell draws forth a massive bolt of electrical energy from the plane of air into the prime, striking the caster's target and nearby foes with a surge of eletricity. Each bolt causes 12d8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8 points per level of the caster, up to a maximum of 21d8. Any creatures within a 7 foot radius are also caught in the blast and take 4d8 of electrical damage, plus 1d8 per two levels up to a maximum of 8d8.

Trollkiller's Fireball is a more powerful version of the level 3 wizard spell, Fireball.  It's namesake, Durlag Trollkiller, commissioned an exiled elven mage of considerable skill to create this spell for use in eradicating trolls from his homeland.  Much to his delight, the creation of the spell was successful and put to great use during his troll-cleansing campaign.  In the years following, as Durlag's madness took hold of him, he kept all of his most prized possessions, including this spell, under lock, key, and devious trap inside his tower.  How it came to be in your possession is a mystery.   When cast, a raging ball of flame flies forth from the caster's hand, striking the target point and exploding in a horrific display of hellfire, doing 1d6 points of damage for each level of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 16d6) to targets caught in the blast.  The searing heat is so intense that it can ignite clothing, armor, and even flesh, causing an additional 1d4 fire damage per round and sending the afflicted into a state of panic until they successfully roll a Save vs. Spell to extinguish the flames.  Those who roll successful a Save vs. Spell manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, taking only half damage from the inital blast, and evade the ongoing fire damage and panic.  All saving throws must be made at -2.~

The chosen of Auril speak of this spell as legend, a power that the Ice Maiden bestows only upon her most favored, and is a closely guarded secret.  It is said this spell conjures forth the very breath of Auril herself.  Cold as the hearts of Auril's followers may be, there are beings far, far more cruel than they in the realms, and it is rumored that one such being, known as "The Shattered One", caputured a high priestess of Auril and performed torturous experiments on her to "extract" this magic for his own use.  Unfortunately for the mage, he was unable to channel the divine energies required for the spell to work properly.  However, the damage was done and the secrets of this magic were shared across the realms, much to Auril's displeasure.  This spell brings forth a gale of icy, frozen wind from the caster's hands, feezing all in it's path with 1d5+1 of cold damage per level, up to a maximum of 20d5+20.   Those afflicted by the blistering cold are frozen in their tracks, hindering their ability to fight unless a saving throw is made.   Those who roll a successful Save vs. Spell will shrug off a portion of the cold, taking half damage and avoid being frozen in place.  All saving throws must be made at -2.  The use of this spell by non-aurilites angers the Ice Maiden greatly and there is a small chance that an enraged golem of ice will form from the gale and attack the party.~

Creatures caught in the area of effect will take 1d10 of acid damage per round that they remain in the caustic fog, and must roll a Saving Throw vs. Spells at a -4 penalty or suffer reduction to their resistances against all forms of physical damage 15% for three rounds.

Level: 5
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell works only on player characters or allied creatures.  When cast, fell, demonic energies are channeled into the target causing them to go berserk, attacking the nearest creature until that creature is dead, then moving on to the next target. While under the effects of Fell Rage, the target is immune to charm, sleep, fear, hold, stunning, confusion, emotion, symbol spells, and related effects. In addition, the target gains +1 to hit, +1 to Strength, +1 to Dexterity, +1 to Constitution, +10 to maximum Hit Points, +2 to <PRO_HISHER> movement rate, 5% Physical Damage Resistance, 30% Fire Resistance, and 1d2 Damage(Acid) to all physical attacks. The spell has several disadvantages, however: The Hit Points of the target are masked for the duration of the spell, and at the end of the spell's duration, the target becomes fatigued and <PRO_HISHER> Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution are reduced by 3 for 2 turns. Fell Rage cannot be cast by or affect creatures of good alignment.~

Saving Throw: Special

This spell conjures forth shadowy orbs of dark energy from the shadow plane that bolt forward from the caster's hand to strike <PRO_HISHER> target with unerring precision. The priest creates one bolt at 9th level and an additional bolt at every third level after 9th—in other words, two bolts at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th, to a maximum of five bolts at 21st level. Each bolt inflicts 1d5 points of cold damage and 1d5 points of magic damage to the target and then bursts in a 5-ft. radius concussive blast that inflicts 6 points of cold damage and 6 points of magic damage, increasing by two points each per every 3 levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 14 per each at level 21.  Addtionally, creatures caught in the dark energy blast suffer a 20% chance of being blinded for one turn or being drained of one level permanently. Creatures can attempt a Save vs. Spell at -4 to negate the concussion damage and effects, but the impact of the bolts themselves allow no Saving Throw.  Undead creatures are immune to the effects of this spell.  Priests of good alignment may not cast this spell.~

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast, the caster is enshrouded by dark shadows, taking on the form of a shadow fiend.  While in this form, <PRO_HESHE> takes on some of the abilities of a shadow monster:  Movement rate is increased by 2, casting speed is increased by 2, attack rate is increased by 1/2 per round, resistance to all physical attacks is increased by 7%, resistances to fire, cold, acid, and magic attacks are increased by 20%, the caster is able to hide and stay hidden in shadows with ease, and <PRO_HISHER> movement cannot be impeded by normal means.  However, the inherent weakness of a shadow monster is also imparted to the caster, and <PRO_HISHER> becomes extremely susceptible to electrical attacks for the duration of the spell.~

Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2 

Ko'Dezza was an eccentric half-drow mage who lived before the time of troubles.  She attempted to create new spells by modifying and enhancing existing spells.  While her experiements met with failure more often than not, this spell was on her more successful efforts.  For all intents and purposes, this spell functions very similar to the level 3 spell, Fireball, except that two or more fireballs are launched simultaneously, and home in on a targetted creature with unerring accuracy.  When this spell is cast, two fireballs are launched at a target, and upon impact, explode in a horrific display of flames, doing 6d6 damage to the target and all creatures within a 15 foot radius of the impact.  For every two levels of the caster, damage is increased by 1d6 up to a maximum of 10d6 at level 22, and for every four levels an additional fireball is launched, up to a maximum of four at level 22.  Thus, a level 22 wizard can fire four fireballs each doing 10d6 fire damage at level 22. As with the level 3 spell, Fireball, creatures who make a Saving Throw per fireball may reduce their damage taken from it by half.  Creatures weak against fire would do well to steer clear of a mage with this spell in <PRO_HISHER> repetoire.~

Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, acrid pools of thick, corrosive ichor rise from the earth and cover the ground.  Any creatures entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast are mired in the sticky substance, which severly hinders their movement while corroding their flesh and armor, doing 1d4 damage(acid) per round, and reducing their physical resistances by 5%, making them more susceptible to melee and ranged attacks.  For every three levels of the caster, damage is increased by one point, and physical resistance is reduced by an additional percentage point, up to a maximum of 1d4+5 and 10%, respectively.  A successful Save vs. Spell at -2 negates the slowed movement and reduced defenses, while halving damage for that round.~

This spell conjures forth shadowy tendrils from the ground that grasp, claw, and pierce the flesh of any creature caught within the area of effect.  Creatures affected suffer 1d4 piercing and 1d4 cold damage per round, increasing by 1 point each for every three levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 1d4+2 cold and 1d4+2 piercing.  Affected creatures must roll a Save vs. Paralyze at -4 or be paralyzed for one and a half rounds.  Creatures that make a saving throw avoid being paralyzed and reduce their damage taken by one half.  Undead creatures are immune to the effects of this spell.  This spell cannot be cast by priests of good alignment.~

Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Ko'Dezza, an eccentric half-drow mage who lived around 1260DR, attempted to create new spells by experimenting with modifying and combining components of existing spells.  More often than not, her attempts met with unmitigated disater, but this spell was one of her more successful ventures.  Upon casting this spell, the wizard summons forth several slime creatures that pool and coagulate into one monstrous, gelatinous golem.  This golem possesses all the strengths of a slime monster, being very resistant to most physical attacks.  However, it also shares the weaknesses of these creatures and is quite vulnerable to fire and acid attacks.  The summoned golem will obey the commands of it's summoner for four rounds, plus one additional round per level of the caster, or until it is destroyed.  There is a 10% chance when casting this spell that two slime golems will be summoned instead of one.~

When this spell is cast, the very earth shakes and is torn asunder sending gouts of flame up from the cracks. The cataclysm affects all creatures in its area of effect, occuring in three waves:

 1st: All creatures affected take 3d6 points of crushing damage, and 3d6 points of fire damage.  Affected creatures are also knocked to the ground, panicked, or go berserk for four rounds.  A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -6 penalty halves the damage and negates the adverse effects.
 2nd: All creatures affected take 1d9 points of crushing damage, and 1d9 points of fire damage.  A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty halves the damage.
 3rd: All creatures affected take 1d6 points of crushing damage, and 1d6 points of fire damage.  A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell halves the damage.

This spell will affect both friend and foe alike, so great care must be taken in its use. Finally, earth and fire elementals are angered by the careless sundering and there is a small chance that casting this spell will cause one to appear and attack the party.~

Upon casting of this spell, the cleric is enshrouded by a mass of swirling darkness conjured from the shadow plane, which acts as a protective barrier against incoming attacks.  The shadows absorb energy from attacks, both physical and magical, that are directed at the caster.  The barrier reduces damage from all attacks by 10%, increasing by an additional percentage point every two levels to a maximum of 15% at level 21.  Additionally, creatures who successfully hit the caster through the shadowy barrier within melee range suffer 1d5 points of magic damage and 1d5 points of cold damage, with a 20% change of being drained of one level as well.  There is no Saving Throw allowed for these effects, though undead creatures are immune.  This spell may not be cast by clerics of good alignment.~

This spell is a more powerful version of the level 5 mage spell, Cloudkill.  When cast, it creates plumes of venemous gas of such toxicity as to immediately sear the flesh of creatures it comes in contact with, entering their bloodstream.  So deadly is this poison as to instantly slay creatures of 8 or fewer Hit Dice, and creatures with 9 or 10 Hit Dice must roll a Saving Throw vs. Poison at -8 for each round they remain in the area of effect, lest they be slain instantly as well.  Those above 10th level (or 10 Hit Dice) must leave the cloud immediately or suffer 1d12 + 1 Hit Points of poison damage per level per round that they remain in the affected area, up to a maximum of 1d12 + 15 Hit Points at level 30.  While remaining in the area of effect, there is a 25% chance per round that creatures will also be systemically poisoned, suffering an additional 2 Hit Points of poison damage per second for 2 rounds, unless they make a Saving Throw vs. poison at -8.  This affliction will persist even after leaving the area of effect.~

When the words of this spell are spoken, the caster conjures forth a Dark Treant to serve <PRO_HIMHER> in battle.  The strength of the summoned treant will increase with the caster as <PRO_HESHE> gains more levels of experience.

  1st – 10th: a 9 HD dark treant.  There is a 50% chance that two dark treants will be summoned instead.

Saving Throw: Special

By way of this spell, the caster summons forth a large boulder 6-ft. in diameter that is then hurled in the direction of <PRO_HISHER> choosing.  Once launched, this unstoppable force of earth plows over and through any creatures in it's path, causing 10d10 Hit Points of crushing damage, with a 15% chance of outright crushing them to death.  Creatures struck by the boulder can roll a Save vs. Spell to sidestep or jump out of the way at the last moment to halve the damage, there is no Saving Throw allowed to avoid the chance of being crushed to death.  Giant-sized creatures are less affected by the boulder and take 5d10 Hit Points of crushing damage, with a successful Save vs. Spell for half.  Giant-sized creatures cannot be instantly killed by the boulder.~

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Ko'Dezza, a half-drow mage who lived in an age past had a natural talent for magic, and attempted to eke out a living by experimenting on existing spells to create new spells and sold scrolls of her creations across the breadth of Faerûn.  This spell in particular was a great success, though it came at the cost of three fingers on her left hand.  When cast, the spell conjures forth a mass of living slime that encapsulates the caster in a protective bubble.  The slime-shell is highly corrosive, and thwarts acidic and physical attacks.  The caster's resistance to acid is increased by 50% for the duration of the spell, and attackers in melee range who successfully strike <PRO_HIMHER> through the shell are checmically burned by it, causing 1d6+2 Hit Points of acid damage, and suffering a penalty of 1 to their THACO score for one round unless a successfull Save vs. Spell at -2 is made.~

When this spell is invoked, the wizard selects a target, carefully calculating it's range, and from each hand a bolt is launched, one of fire, the other, ice.  The missiles home in on their target with unerring accuracy and collide, resulting in a horrific explosion sending molten shrapnel and frozen shards flying outward in a 15-ft. radius, doing 6d6 Hit Points of fire damage, and 6d6 Hit Points of cold damage to the target and any creatures caught in the area of effect.  This spell increases in strength with the casters level, doing an additional 2d6 Hit Dice each for every four levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 12d6 each at level 24. Creatures failing their Saving Throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful Saving Throws are nimble enough to dodge or take cover at the last moment, only taking half of the damage.~

When this spell is cast, the wizard opens a portal to the plane of fire in the sky above the battlefield, and pulls down a vortex of intense flames and super-heated air.  The swirling mass of fire touches down to the earth, then moves about unpredictably, scorching any creatures in it's path. The caster is immune to <PRO_HISHER> own spell, but <PRO_HISHER> companions are not, and must be wary.  If a creature is caught in the path of the burning vortex, it takes 8d8 fire damage, increasing by one point of damage per level of the caster, up to a maximum of 8d8+12.  Creatures may make a Saving Throw vs. Breath to halve the damage, but they must do so with a -6 penalty.  There is a 10% chance that affected creatures will be instantly incinerated to death, with no Saving Throw allowed.  A maximum of 6 creatures can be affected, after which the vortex will dissipate back into the fire plane.  Creatures immune to fire are not affected by this spell.~

When this spell is cast, the druid draws forth a globule of viscous, caustic slime, which is then hurled towards a creature of the druid's choosing.  When struck by the slime, creatures suffer 1d3+2 Hit Points of acid damage, and their resistance to all forms of physical damage is lowered by 3 percent for one round.  For every 3 levels of experience of the caster, an additional globule is added to the volley, up to a maximum of 7 at level 24.  There is no Saving Throw allowed for the effects of this spell.~

When the priest chants this spell, a swirling misama of living shadow blankets an area of the caster's choosing.  Creatures caught in the maw of this hungering mass suffer 2d4 Hit Points of cold and 2d4 Hit Points of magic damage per round while they are in the area of effect, their level of fatigue increased by one, and must make a Saving Throw or also be held for one round and drained of two levels permanently.  The Saving throw against being held must be made at a penatly of -8, and -2 for being drained.  The caster and undead creatures are immune to the effects of this spell.

The first scroll containing this spell was discovered when a group of adventurers happened across a blasted hovel deep within the Spine of the World.  Under the remains lay a small laboratory that had apparently suffered a major magical mishap.  The scroll was firmly in the grasp of a necrotic, yet seemingly permanently frozen half-drowish hand.  It would be Ko'Dezza's final work, and her doom as well.  When cast, the wizard channels a massive amount of dark energy from the heart of the shadow plane into a singular point on the battlefield until it reaches critical mass, then explodes violently outward in all directions, ripping through any creatures in it's path, causing 7d10 Hit Points of cold damage and 7d10 Hit Points of magic damage.  There is a small chance that a creature hit by this dark energy will unwittingly become a conduit for a shadow elemental to enter the prime, resulting in their evisceration upon it's arrival.  The enraged elemental will attack the nearest creature, both friend and foe alike, until it is utterly destroyed.  There is no Saving Throw allowed for any of the effects of this spell.  Undead creatures are immune to the effects of this spell.~

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting a Conjure Shadow Elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the Plane of Shadow, and a shadow elemental is summoned in the vicinity of the caster. There is a 60% chance that a 12-Hit-Dice elemental appears; a 35% chance that a 16-Hit-Dice elemental appears; and a 5% chance that a 24-Hit-Dice elemental appears. The elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain or the duration of the spell runs out. All the commands given to the elemental are done telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication and no need to know the language of the summoned creature. Unlike Mages, priests do not have to engage in a battle of the minds to control their elemental.  This spell may not be cast by clerics of good alignment.~
